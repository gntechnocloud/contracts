# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```

Note :- First 9 Closing No Direct Required.
Then Next 9 Closing Require 1 Direct of Same Slot (1X of Business, This Can Be from Multiple Referral of Lower Slots as well, his Total Referral Business After 90 Days must be equal to His Max Slot Value.) as User It Self, If Direct Refferal Is Lower Then Self Slot then Will Get Magic Pool Income of the Referred Person Max Slot Level. For Example If Person P0 is at Slot 5 and He Referrs a Person P1 oF Slot 3 then P0 Will Get Magic Pool Income From Slot 1 to Slot 3 Only.
